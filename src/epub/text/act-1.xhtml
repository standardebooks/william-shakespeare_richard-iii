									<span>Now is the winter of our discontent</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Made glorious summer by this sun of York;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And all the clouds that lour’d upon our house</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Grim-visaged war hath smooth’d his wrinkled front;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He capers nimbly in a lady’s chamber</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I, that am rudely stamp’d, and want love’s majesty</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I, that am curtail’d of this fair proportion,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Deform’d, unfinish’d, sent before my time</span>

									<br/>
									<span>And that so lamely and unfashionable</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Have no delight to pass away the time,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Unless to spy my shadow in the sun</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And descant on mine own deformity:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I am determined to prove a villain</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And hate the idle pleasures of these days.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To set my brother Clarence and the king</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In deadly hate the one against the other:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And if King Edward be as true and just</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As I am subtle, false and treacherous,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>This day should Clarence closely be mew’d up,</span>
									<br/>
