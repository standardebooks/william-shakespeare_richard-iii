									<span>For happy wife, a most distressed widow;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For joyful mother, one that wails the name;</span>

									<span>For queen, a very caitiff crown’d with care;</span>

									<br/>
									<span>For one being fear’d of all, now fearing one;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For one commanding all, obey’d of none.</span>

									<span>Thus hath the course of justice wheel’d about,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And left thee but a very prey to time;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Having no more but thought of what thou wert,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To torture thee the more, being what thou art.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen’d yoke;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From which even here I slip my weary neck,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And leave the burthen of it all on thee.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Farewell, York’s wife, and queen of sad mischance:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>These English woes will make me smile in France.</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Advantaging their loan with interest</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of ten times double gain of happiness.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go;</span>

									<span>Make bold her bashful years with your experience;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Prepare her ears to hear a wooer’s tale;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess</span>

									<span>The petty rebel, dull-brain’d Buckingham,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bound with triumphant garlands will I come</span>
