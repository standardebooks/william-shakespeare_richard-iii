									<span>Remember whom you are to cope withal;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whom their o’er-cloyed country vomits forth</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To desperate ventures and assured destruction.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They would restrain the one, distain the other.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Long kept in Bretagne at our mother’s cost?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A milk-sop, one that never in his life</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Let’s whip these stragglers o’er the seas again;</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For want of means, poor rats, had hang’d themselves:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If we be conquer’d, let men conquer us,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Have in their own land beaten, bobb’d, and thump’d,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in record, left them the heirs of shame.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives?</span>
									<br/>
